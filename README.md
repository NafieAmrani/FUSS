## üßë‚ÄçüíªÔ∏è‚Äç Installation
```bash 
conda create -n fuss python=3.9 # create new viertual environment
conda activate fuss
conda install pytorch=1.13.0 torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia # install pytorch

## üìù Dataset
The pancreas dataset from Med Decathalon Dataset used in this paper was processed using mesh grooming tools. Please download the datasets from the this [link](https://www.shapeworks-cloud.org/#/) and put all datasets under ../data/. 
Other datasets can be processed in a similar fashion given CT or MRI images and their corresponding segmentations. 
```Shell
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pancreas
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ off 
```
We thank the original dataset providers for their contributions, and that all credits should go to the original authors.

## Data preparation
For data preprocessing, we provide *[preprocess.py](preprocess.py)* to compute all things we need.
Here is an example for pancreas.
```python
python preprocess.py --data_root ../data/pancreas/ --n_eig 200
```

## Train
To train the model on a specified dataset.
```python
python train.py --opt options/train/pancreas.yaml 
```
You can visualize the training process in tensorboard.
```bash
tensorboard --logdir experiments/
```

## Test
To test the model on a specified dataset.
```python
python test.py --opt options/test/pancreas.yaml 
```
The qualitative and quantitative results will be saved in [results](results) folder.
